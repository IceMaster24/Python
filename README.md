This is a simple YouTube downloader, it has been developed on Windows and tested with the CMD.

To install the pytube library open the terminal or the CMD and type: pip install pytube
its folder on Windows should be in the following directory:    c:\users\your_user\appdata\local\programs\python\python310\lib\site-packages 

the modules "os" and "sys" are already present on python so you don't have to install them.



hope it can be useful to see the operation of the pytube library, BREAK A LEG PROGRAMMER!!!!
