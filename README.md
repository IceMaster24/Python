# Python YouTube downloader 



This is a simple YouTube downloader, it has been developed on Windows and tested with the CMD.

To install the pytube library open the terminal or the CMD and type: pip install pytube
its folder on Windows should be in the following directory: 

```

c:\users\your_user\appdata\local\programs\python\python310\lib\site-packages

```

the modules `os` and `sys` are already present on python so you don't have to install them.

##


hope it can be useful to see the operation of the pytube library so:
